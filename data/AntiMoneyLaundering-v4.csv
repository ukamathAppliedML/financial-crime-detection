1,"Hi Sarah, I've been working with Mr. Johnson on his investment strategy. He specifically asked me to help him structure his deposits to stay below 10k each time.

1,"We have a new client who's very particular about transaction amounts. He insists on keeping everything under 3k and gets nervous when we mention any reporting thresholds.

1,"Mrs. Chen wants to set up all her transfers through her nephew who lives in Hong Kong. She mentioned she trusts him more than banks and prefers the 3rd party arrangement.

1,"The client insists on using a third party service for wire transfers to avoid direct involvement. He says it's for privacy reasons and doesn't want his name on any documentation. The intermediary company seems legitimate, but I can't find much information about their business. What's your take on this?","Third Party Transfer"
0,"The wire transfer requires third party approval from their corporate compliance department. This is standard procedure for their company and they've provided all necessary authorization letters. We've worked with their approval process many times before. The transaction should go through smoothly tomorrow.","Third Party Transfer"

1,"I've been reviewing the Patterson account and there are some anti-money laundering concerns with the transaction patterns.

1,"The client asked me about ways to minimize his tax burden on the investment gains. He specifically wants to avoid paying taxes on the offshore portfolio returns.

1,"Mr. Rodriguez wants to structure his investments to avoid getting taxed heavily on the capital gains. He mentioned reading about strategies online and wants to implement something similar. The conversation focused on avoiding tax payments rather than legitimate tax planning. I'm not sure we should be advising on this approach.","Tax Avoidance"
1,"The client is looking for creative ways to avoid tax obligations on his recent inheritance. He asked about offshore trusts and other structures that would help him avoid paying taxes.

1,"The client has been making deposits in a pattern that appears designed to avoid detection. He brings in amounts just under 10k and spaces them out over different days. When I asked about the source, he became defensive and said it's just how his business works. The structured approach is raising red flags for me.","Structuring"
1,"I've noticed the Johnson account shows classic signs of structuring transactions to avoid reporting. Multiple deposits of 9800, 9900, and similar amounts over the past few months. The client seems to understand the reporting thresholds very well. We should probably file a SAR on this activity pattern.","Structuring"

1,"I'm seeing a pattern that looks like classic smurfing across multiple accounts. Different people are making small deposits but they all seem connected somehow. The amounts are always just under the reporting thresholds and the timing is suspicious. The activity appears to be coordinated to avoid detection.","Smurfing"
1,"The Martinez account is receiving deposits from various individuals that appear to be smurfing. The transactions are small but frequent, and the depositors seem to know each other.
